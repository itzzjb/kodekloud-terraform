# Traditional IT and Challenges

### Disadvantages of the traditional model:

1. The turnover time can range between weeks to months. This is just to get the system to ready state to begin the application deployment. Includes the time it takes to the system to be procured and hand it over between teams. Also scaling up and scaling down infrastructure on demand cannot be achieved quickly.
2. The overall cost to deploy and maintain this model is generally quiet high.
3. While some aspects of the infrastructure profiling process can be automated, several steps like rack and stack, cabling and other deployment procedures are manual and slow.
4. With so many teams are working on so many different tasks chances of human error are high and this results in inconsistent environments.
5. Another major disadvantage of this model is the under utilization of the compute resources. The infrastructure sizing activity will generally carried out well in advance and the severs are sized considering the peak utilization. The inability to scala up or down easily means most of these resources would not be used during off-peak hours.
